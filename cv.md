## Research Experience

### Professional Experience

**Oregon Health and Science University/\nOregon National Primate Research Center** 

- Transcriptomics & Systems Biology: Specializes in high-dimensional analysis of immune cell dynamics and correlates of protection for diseases such as HIV/SIV, Tuberculosis, and Yellow Fever.
