# Research

My research integrates computational and experimental approaches to understand complex biological systems, with particular focus on spatial transcriptomics, infectious disease, and bacterial stress responses.

## Current Research

### Spatial and Single-Cell Transcriptomics in Infectious Disease

**Integration of Spatial and scRNA-seq Data for Infectious Diseases (SIV/TB/CMV/Malaria)**

I develop computational frameworks to integrate spatial transcriptomics (NanoString GeoMx, CosMx) with single-cell RNA-seq data to identify novel pathologically relevant cell states in rhesus macaque models of SIV and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection. This work bridges tissue-level pathology with cellular-level molecular mechanisms, revealing how immune cells respond to infection at unprecedented spatial resolution.

*Key Technologies*: 10X Genomics single-cell sequencing, NanoString GeoMx/CosMx spatial transcriptomics, cell type deconvolution, spatial statistics

### Bacterial Stress Response and Antibiotic Tolerance

**Characterizing Stimulon Overlap and Persistence Mechanisms**

Using transcriptomic profiling and mathematical modeling, I investigate how *E. coli* responds to divergent stresses and enters antibiotic-tolerant persister states. This work reveals overlapping gene expression programs (stimulons) activated by different stressors and provides insights into the molecular basis of antibiotic tolerance.

*Publications*: Wang et al. (2023, 2021) - Co-first author

*Key Approaches*: Bulk RNA-seq, differential expression analysis, stochastic modeling, time-series analysis
