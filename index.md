## About Me

I am a Computational Biology PhD with expertise in transcriptomics, spatial biology, and mathematical modeling. My research combines cutting-edge experimental techniques with computational approaches to understand complex biological systems, particularly in the contexts of infectious disease and immunology.

My work spans multiple scales, from molecular dynamics and protein docking to single-cell transcriptomics and spatial biology, with a focus on developing integrative analytical frameworks that bridge experimental and computational biology.

## Research Interests

- **Spatial and Single-Cell Transcriptomics**: Integration of spatial transcriptomics (NanoString GeoMx/CosMx) with single-cell RNA-seq data to identify pathologically relevant cell states and tissue microenvironments
- **Infectious Disease & Immunology**: Understanding host-pathogen interactions, particularly in SIV and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection models
- **Mathematical & Computational Modeling**: Agent-based models, stochastic processes, and multiscale simulations of biological systems
- **Bacterial Stress Response**: Characterizing antibiotic tolerance, persistence, and stimulon overlap in *E. coli*

## Current Focus

My recent work integrates spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to identify novel pathologically relevant markers in SIV- and TB-infected rhesus macaques, bridging the gap between tissue-level pathology and cellular-level molecular mechanisms.

## Highlights

- **Publications**: Co-first author on studies of bacterial stress responses and antibiotic tolerance; contributor to bioinformatics tools for cell hashing demultiplexing
- **Technical Expertise**: Deep experience with transcriptomic pipelines, machine learning, protein modeling, and high-performance computing
- **Multidisciplinary Background**: Training in mathematics, physics, molecular biology, and computational biology
